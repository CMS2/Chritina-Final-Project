        Christina Rossetti is one of the best female poets of all time.
        Born in England in 1830, and started composing verses before she <br />could write and wrote her first full poem when she was 11.
        Most of her poetic works reflect her Anglo-Catholic faith.<br /> She is perhaps best known for her ‘Goblin Market’ but she has also written more than 300 other works.<br />
        'Vanity of Vanities' is an example of her faith based poetic works.<br /> It is based on the book of Ecclesiastes.</p>
      <p class="wow"> <i> Vanity of vanities, the Preacher saith,<br />
        All things are vanity. The eye and ear<br />
        Cannot be filled with what they see and hear.<br />
        Like early dew, or like the sudden breath<br />
        Of wind, or like the grass that withereth,<br />
        Is man, tossed to and fro by hope and fear:<br />
        So little joy hath he, so little cheer,<br />
        Till all things end in the long dust of death.<br />
        To-day is still the same as yesterday,<br />
        To-morrow also even as one of them;<br />
        And there is nothing new under the sun:<br />
        Until the ancient race of Time be run,<br />
        The old thorns shall grow out of the old stem,<br />
        And morning shall be cold and twilight grey.</i>
      </p>

        She continued to be a prolific poet until her death in 1894.
