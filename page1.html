                Throughout her life, Rossetti wrote a total of around 320 poems.<br /> Here is a list of some of her best works.<br />

                 <b>The Love Of Christ Which Passeth Knowledge</b><br />
                                                          <br />                                            
                I bore with thee long weary days and nights,<br />
Through many pangs of heart, through many tears;<br />
I bore with thee, thy hardness, coldness, slights,<br />
For three and thirty years.<br />
                                    <br />
Who else had dared for thee what I have dared?<br />
I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above;<br />
I not My flesh, I not My spirit spared:<br />
Give thou Me love for love.<br />
                                 <br />
For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth,<br />
For thee I trembled in the nightly frost: <br />
Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth:<br />
Why wilt thou still be lost?<br />
                                  <br />
I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced:<br />
Men only marked upon My shoulders borne<br />
The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced,<br />
Or wagged their heads in scorn.<br />
                                     <br />
Thee did nails grave upon My hands, thy name<br />
Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes:<br />
I, Holy One, put on thy guilt and shame;<br />
I, God, Priest, Sacrifice. <br />
                                 <br />
A thief upon My right hand and My left;<br />
Six hours alone, athirst, in misery:<br />
At length in death one smote My heart and cleft<br />
A hiding-place for thee.<br />
                                     <br />
Nailed to the racking cross, than bed of down<br />
More dear, whereon to stretch Myself and sleep:<br />
So did I win a kingdom,—share my crown;<br />
A harvest,—come and reap. <br />
                             <br />

                <b>Christmas Eve</b><br />
                                    <br />
                  CHRISTMAS hath darkness<br />
                  Brighter than the blazing noon,<br />
                  Christmas hath a chillness<br />
                  Warmer than the heat of June,<br />
                  Christmas hath a beauty<br />
                  Lovelier than the world can show:<br />
                  For Christmas bringeth Jesus,<br />
                  Brought for us so low.<br />
                  Earth, strike up your music,<br />
                  Birds that sing and bells that ring;<br />
                  Heaven hath answering music<br />
                  For all Angels soon to sing:<br />
                  Earth, put on your whitest<br />
                  Bridal robe of spotless snow:<br />
                  For Christmas bringeth Jesus,<br />
                  Brought for us so low. <br />

                                      <br />
                Am I a stone and not a sheep<br />
That I can stand, O Christ, beneath Thy Cross,<br />
To number drop by drop Thy Blood's slow loss,<br />
And yet not weep?<br />
                                     <br />
Not so those women loved<br />
Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee;<br />
Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly;<br />
Not so the thief was moved;<br />
                                  <br />
Not so the Sun and Moon<br />
Which hid their faces in a starless sky, <br />
A horror of great darkness at broad noon—<br />
I, only I.<br />
                                  <br />
Yet give not o'er,<br />
But seek Thy sheep, true Shepherd of the flock;<br />
Greater than Moses, turn and look once more<br />
And smite a rock. <br />
                        <br />

                <b>Summer</b>
                         <br />
                Winter is cold-hearted <br />
Spring is yea and nay, <br />
Autumn is a weather-cock <br />
Blown every way: <br />
Summer days for me <br />
When every leaf is on its tree; <br />
                                  <br />

When Robin's not a beggar, <br />
And Jenny Wren's a bride, <br />
And larks hang singing, singing, singing, <br />
Over the wheat-fields wide,<br /> 
And anchored lilies ride, <br />
And the pendulum spider <br />
Swings from side to side, <br />
                                    <br />

And blue-black beetles transact business, <br />
And gnats fly in a host, <br />
And furry caterpillars hasten <br />
That no time be lost, <br />
And moths grow fat and thrive, <br />
And ladybirds arrive.<br /> 
                                <br />

Before green apples blush, <br />
Before green nuts embrown, <br />
Why, one day in the country<br /> 
Is worth a month in town; <br />
Is worth a day and a year <br />
Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion<br /> 
That days drone elsewhere. <br />
